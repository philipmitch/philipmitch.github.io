            <p class="reveal2">I am a student at 
                <strong>George Brown College</strong> looking to work as a freelance UX Designer upon graduating from the <span>Interaction Design</span> program. I am looking to help clients rebrand their business or build a successful start-up business by using some of the best and most recent design practices.</p>   
            <p>I believe an effective brand identity will visually communicate the personality and values of the business. It will allow the customers to see what the brand is about, what it stands for and how they can expect to feel when they interact with it.</p>
